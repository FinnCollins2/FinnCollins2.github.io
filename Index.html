				Hi! My name is Finn Collins  
                
				<br />
				<br />
				I’m 20 years old and looking for a Software Engineer Apprenticeship starting from this November/ 2024.
                I’m currently self-funding an online course in Codecademy which I expect to complete by the end of October. 
                I chose this course because it qualifies and gives me experience and insight into “Full Stack” is a course that Microsoft, Google and Meta look for completion in candidates. 
                I have successfully completed 75% of the course and will have completed the rest of the course over the next couple of weeks. 
                I have a good set of GCSEs with an A in ICT. I lost my way a bit at A level partly because I did not know who I was or 
                what I wanted to do in life and partly because I did realize that I needed to put the work in over and above what was taught in the classroom. 
                I took some time out to reassess by Volunteering in Costa Rica and Croatia. 
                I realized two key points that firstly I actually like who I am and also, I am good at ICT. 
                I find my online course straight forward and enjoyable. Secondly, I now realize that I need to take personal responsibility for my success and that there are no excuses for underperforming my potential, 
                it’s down to me. I believe if you like something and you are good at it and prepared to work hard for it you will be successful. 
				<br />
				<br />
				I’m told by people who know me and those I work with that I’ve changed a lot over the past year or so. 
                They say I’m coachable, eager to learn and prepared to turn my hand to anything and get stuck in. 
                I’m a problem solver, clear communicator, fair minded, fun to be around and a team player. 
                I’m also organized and motivated to make myself the best I can be. 
                I’m looking for the best Software Development Apprenticeship I can find and my commitment to any employer who has such an opportunity is that 
                I will give the best of me to make the most of it. I will do whatever it takes to be successful because I know I like ICT and am good at ICT. 
                Importantly I also know the things I need to do to make myself successful.
